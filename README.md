# Network Community Architecture Tools

This is the corresponding python version of our newly developed and freely downloadable MATLAB toolbox( http://commdetect.weebly.com/) devoted to characterizing community architecture in arbitrary networks extracted from any neuroimaging data set and composed of any number of nodes or edges. The toolbox offers code to compute network diagnostics in 4 principle areas:

(i) static community architecture (including community size and strength),

(ii) dynamic community architecture (including flexibility and stationarity),

(iii) community significance in comparison to a family of null models, and

(iv) spatial organization (including radius and hemispheric laterality).

Required package: numpy,scipy
